This repository contains a version of the digital adaption of neurological eye examination. 



The Dot Test is designed to assess the quality of eye coordination for each saccade. A clinician observes the movement of both eyes as the patient shifts their gaze from target to target. The clinician looks for the eyes to suddenly move to the next visual target and stop accurately at its destination. Abnormal signs include the eyes stopping short or too far away from the target, known as under or over-shooting, respectively, or the eyes do not initiate a saccade.

The H Test is designed to assess the quality of eye movement at a constant slow pace as the eyes track a visual target, smooth pursuit in all directions. The "H" pattern ensures that both eyes track the target in all directions to their end ranges. Abnormal signs consist of the eyes lacking motion, or its initiation, in any direction or the eyes utilizing saccades to catch up to the moving visual target.

The optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) test measures an individual's ability to perform smooth pursuit, similar to the H test, and their ability to initiate a saccade to fixate on the following visual target after the first target disappears. The visual stimulus is typically vertical bars with high contrast to the background. The bars move at a quick and constant pace from right to left. This is repeated in the opposite direction. OKN typically remains preserved in individuals with occipital lobe infarcts, with limited amplitude if there is a hemifield defect. Asymmetry in the performance of the eyes or poor ability to generate saccades may suggest damage to the optic, brainstem, or cerebellar nuclei or tracts.
